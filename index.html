                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City, with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It was chosen in 
                <br>1983 as one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational Education Project (TVEP) of the then Department 
                <br>of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth and development in 
                <br>the country.</p>

                <p>The college was an accredited regional trade skills training and testing center in Region 1 by the Technical Education and Skills 
                <br>Development Authority (TESDA) and a regional training center in ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center of the 
                <br>Philippines.</p>
                    
                <p>It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one among 18 established in nominated partner schools in the country under the 
                <br>Toyota Automotive Education Program (TAEP) of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned to 
                <br>become the regional skills development center in automotive servicing.</p>
                    
                <p>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program 
                <br>(ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. The ETEEAP is a 
                <br>comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives equivalencies to 
                <br>knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes that education and the 
                <br>acquisition of higher expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT degree may be granted to 
                <br>individuals through the recognition of their knowledge and skills gained from non-formal or informal learning. The recognition of 
                <br>the knowledge and skills are done through equivalency and assessment by assessors of the College.</p>
